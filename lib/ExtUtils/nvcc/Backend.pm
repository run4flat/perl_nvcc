ExtUtils::nvcc::Backend - Backend to CUDA compiler and linker wrapper for Perl's toolchain

=cut

use strict;
use warnings;

package ExtUtils::nvcc::Backend;

# For errors, of course:
use Carp qw(croak);

# To check if this is a windows perl built with gcc:
use Config;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is meant to be used from the command-line, invoking either the C<compiler>
or C<linker> functions like so:

 prompt> perl -MExtUtils::nvcc::Backend \
              -eExtUtils::nvcc::Backend::compiler -- \
              source.c -o test_prog

For verbosity, supply the -v flag (after the double-dash) or call the C<verbose>
function:

 prompt> perl -MExtUtils::nvcc::Backend \
              -eExtUtils::nvcc::Backend::compiler -- \
              source.c -v -o test_prog
 
 prompt> perl -MExtUtils::nvcc::Backend \
              -e"ExtUtils::nvcc::Backend::verbose;ExtUtils::nvcc::Backend::compiler"
              -- source.c -o test_prog


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions to convert arbitrary command-line arguments to
acceptable nvcc arguments and invoke nvcc to compile or link your code.
Generally speaking, you won't need to worry about this module and should stick
with functions from L<ExtUtils::nvcc> that provide configuration options for the
common Perl toolchains.

However, if you are working on your own toolchain and need to invoke nvcc with
Perl's original build arguments, you'll probably want to use this module. The
command-line examples in the SYNOPSIS hopefully give you enough to get started
playing around.

At this point, you may be curious why I didn't just put the command-line
processing in the front-end library, L<ExtUtils::nvcc>. The reason is simple:
nvcc's behavior depends on the filename's ending (can't set it with a flag, as
far as I can tell), so filenames with CUDA code I<must> have a .cu ending.
I could subclass each of Perl's toolchains (L<Inline::C>, L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>,
and L<Module::Build>) to accomodate CUDA, but I decided it would be better to
create this drop-in replacement for gcc. Since I have to have a layer between
the toolchains and nvcc to rename .c files to .cu files, and since I need to
process arguments, I decided to roll the whole thing into one.

=head2 compiler

The compiler function processes all arguments in C<@ARGS>, wraps them in such a
way that nvcc knows how to process them, and ensures that nvcc compiles the
source files as cuda files (even if they have a .c extension).

sub compiler {
	# First make sure that we have arguments (since I'll need a file to
	# compile, in the very least):
	die "Nothing to do! You didn't give me any arguments, not even a file!\n"

		if @other_args;
	
	# Run nvcc (errors will propogate with death)
	run_nvcc(@nvcc_args, @source_files);
}

=head2 linker

The linker function processes all arguments in C<@ARGS>, and invokes nvcc
as a linker with properly modified arguments.

		if @linker_args;
	
	# Run nvcc.
	run_nvcc(@nvcc_args, @source_files);
}

=head2 run_nvcc

Runs nvcc with the supplied list of nvcc-compatible command-line arguments,
using the L<system> Perl function.

If the system call fails, run_nvcc checks that it can find nvcc in the first
place, and croaks with one of two messages:

=over

=item nvcc encountered a problem

This message means that nvcc is in your path but the system call failed, which
means that the compile didn't like what you sent it.

=item Unable to run nvcc. Is it in your path?

This message means that nvcc cannot be found. Make sure you've installed nVidia's
toolkit and double-check your path settings.

=back

To use, try something like this:

 run_nvcc qw(my_source.cu -o my_program);

=head2 process_args

Processes the list of supplied (gcc-style) arguments, seperating out 
nvcc-compatible arguments, and nvcc-incompatible arguments, and source file
names. The resulting lists are returned by reference in that order.

Here's a usage example:

 # Get the nvcc args, the compiler args, and the source files:
 my ($nvcc_args, $other_args, $source_files) = process_args(@ARGV);
 
 # Unpack array refs into normal arrays
 my @nvcc_args = @$nvcc_args;
 my @other_args = @$other_args;
 my @source_files = @$source_files;

# Purpose		: Process the command-line arguments, seperating out the nvcc-
#				: compatible options from the source file names and the other

# Returns		: Three array references containing
#				:	- nvcc args
#				:	- other args
#				:	- file names
# Parameters	: The array of command-line options to be processed.
# Throws		: if the last argument was expecting a value, such as -o file.o
#				: but without the file.o bit.
# Comments		: The means by which this function performs its work is hackish,
#				: but I doubt it needs to be improved except possibly for
#				: legibility. Perhaps all of these options can be seperated into
#				: some text file, or put in the __DATA__ section, in more readable

This function simply sets the package global variable C<$verbose> to a true

functions. See the L</SYNOPSIS> for an example of use.
